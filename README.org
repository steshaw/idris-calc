* Calc

A simple arithmetic calculator/interpreter written in [[http://idris-lang.org][Idris]]. It's
more-or-less a port of the calc implementation from the
[[http://andrej.com/plzoo/][plzoo]]. However, since there's no LR/LALR parser generator for Idris
that I know of, it uses the Lightyear parser combinator package for
both lexing and parsing (rather than the lex/yacc/menhir approach of
plzoo/calc).
